    <h3>What is HTTP</h3>
    <P>hThe Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web pages
        using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked
        devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves a
        client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.</P>

                        no one resource blocks any other resource. HTTP/2 does this by splitting data into binary-code
                        messages and numbering these messages so that the client knows which stream each binary message
                        belongs to.</td>

                        this approach is not always practical for modern webpages, which often involve several dozen
                        separate resources that the client must request.</td>
                    <td>HTTP/2 solves this problem by allowing a server to "push" content to a client before the client
                        asks for it. The server also sends a message letting the client know what pushed content to
                        expect â€“ like if Bob had sent Alice a Table of Contents of his novel before sending the whole
                        thing.</td>

                        HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.</td>
                    <td>HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant
                        information in HTTP header packets. This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packet. Given
                        the volume of HTTP packets involved in loading even a single webpage, those bytes add up
                        quickly, resulting in faster loading.</td>
