        <h2>Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript</h2>
        <p class="text one">Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for
            modern JavaScript.
            These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null,
            undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each
            (depending on their types).</p>
        <p class="text two">Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive
            data-types as well as
            reference data-types. 
            An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or
            a
            pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is
            stored.
            The variables don’t actually store the value.</p>
        <p class="text three">Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of
            related data, of primitive
            or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are
            called
            properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.</p>
        <p class="text four"> For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id,
            etc and methods like
            updateAddress, updateNam, etc.</p>

        <h3>Objects and properties</h3>

        <p class="text five">A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be
            explained as a variable
            that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables,
            except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.
            You
            access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:</p>

        <div>
            <span class="code one">objectName.propertyName</span>
        </div>

        <p class="text six">Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and
            property name are case
            sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let’s create an object named
            myCar
            and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:</p>

        <div>
            <span class="code two">var myCar = new Object();
                myCar.make = 'Ford';
                myCar.model = 'Mustang';
                myCar.year = 1969;
            </span>
        </div>
        <p class="text seven">Unassigned properties of an object are undefined (and not null).</p>

        <span class="code three">myCar.color; // undefined</span>

        <p class="text eight">Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation (for
            more details see
            property accessors). Objects are sometimes called associative arrays, since each property is associated with
            a
            string value that can be used to access it. So, for example, you could access the properties of the myCar
            object
            as follows:</p>

        <div>
            <span class="code four">myCar['make'] = 'Ford';
                myCar['model'] = 'Mustang';
                myCar['year'] = 1969;
            </span>
        </div>

        <p class="text nine">An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string, or anything that can be
            converted to a string,
            including the empty string. However, any property name that is not a valid JavaScript identifier (for
            example, a
            property name that has a space or a hyphen, or that starts with a number) can only be accessed using the
            square
            bracket notation. This notation is also very useful when property names are to be dynamically determined
            (when
            the property name is not determined until runtime). Examples are as follows:
        </p>

        <div class="code five">           
                <p>// four variables are created and assigned in a single go,</p>
                <p>// separated by commas</p>
                <p>var myObj = new Object(),</p>
                <p>str = 'myString',</p>
                <p>rand = Math.random(),</p>
                <p>obj = new Object();</p>
                <p>myObj.type = 'Dot syntax';</p>
                <p>myObj['date created'] = 'String with space';</p>
                <p>myObj[str] = 'String value';</p>
                <p>myObj[rand] = 'Random Number';</p>
                <p>myObj[obj] = 'Object';</p>
                <p>myObj[''] = 'Even an empty string';console.log(myObj);      
        </div>

        <p class="text ten">You can also access properties by using a string value that is stored in a variable:</p>
    </div>
